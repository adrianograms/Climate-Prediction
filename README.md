# Climate Prediction
This is a notebook developed on Kaggle and copied to github. This notebook was built on a dataset of weather information from India. The main objective of this project was to predict the mean temperature of a specific day based on the previous days, a time series problem basically. I tried various approaches on this one to see  which one works better and to understand more about time series in general.\
